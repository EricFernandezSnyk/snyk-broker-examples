# GitHub Enterprise
To use the Broker client with a GitHub Enterprise deployment, run `docker pull snyk/broker:github-enterprise` tag. The following environment variables are mandatory to configure the Broker client:

- `BROKER_TOKEN` - the Snyk Broker token, obtained from your Snyk Org settings view (app.snyk.io).
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - a personal access token with full `repo`, `read:org` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes.
- `GITHUB` - the hostname of your GitHub Enterprise deployment, such as `your.ghe.domain.com`.
- `GITHUB_API` - the API endpoint of your GitHub Enterprise deployment. Should be `your.ghe.domain.com/api/v3`.
- `GITHUB_GRAPHQL` - the graphql endpoint of your GitHub Enterprise deployment. Should be `your.ghe.domain.com/api`.
- `PORT` - the local port at which the Broker client accepts connections. Default is 7341.
- `BROKER_CLIENT_URL` - the full URL of the Broker client as it will be accessible by your GitHub Enterprise deployment webhooks, such as `http://my.broker.client:7341`

#### Command-line arguments

You can run the docker container by providing the relevant configuration:

```console
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e GITHUB=your.ghe.domain.com \
           -e GITHUB_API=your.ghe.domain.com/api/v3 \
           -e GITHUB_GRAPHQL=your.ghe.domain.com/api \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=http://my.broker.client:8000 \
       snyk/broker:github-enterprise
```

#### Derived docker image

Another option is to build your own docker image and override relevant environment variables:

```dockerfile
FROM snyk/broker:github-enterprise

ENV BROKER_TOKEN      secret-broker-token
ENV GITHUB_TOKEN      secret-github-token
ENV GITHUB            your.ghe.domain.com
ENV GITHUB_API        your.ghe.domain.com/api/v3
ENV GITHUB_GRAPHQL    your.ghe.domain.com/api
ENV PORT              8000
ENV BROKER_CLIENT_URL http://my.broker.client:8000
```
